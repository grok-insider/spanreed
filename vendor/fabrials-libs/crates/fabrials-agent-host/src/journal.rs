//! Intent before effect, idempotency, the event cursor, and review records.
//!
//! This module carries the recovery invariants of grok-desktop-portable `docs/protocol.md`:
//!
//! - intent is persisted before an effect is dispatched;
//! - a replayed idempotency key never executes twice;
//! - no ambiguous prompt or permission decision is retried automatically;
//! - an effect with no durable known outcome ends in `interrupted_needs_review`.
//!
//! The event cursor design follows `docs/decisions/0008-resumable-run-event-long-poll.md`;
//! the code is independent because that implementation carries Desktop policy.
