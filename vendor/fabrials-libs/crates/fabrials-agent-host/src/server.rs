//! Implements the transport rules of grok-desktop-portable `docs/protocol.md`
//! and ADR light 0006. Every response carries the strict header set; every request is
//! checked for an exact `Host`, an `Origin` appropriate to its method, a

//! Rejection is uniform: the host answers the same status for a failed origin,
